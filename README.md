# Digital Image Processing - USTH 2020
Research about segmentation's application

[x] <b>Question</b>
```What is “image segmentation”?```
<br>
[x] <b>Answer</b>
```Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as image objects). The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze.```
- There are several applications:
    - Machine vision
    - Medical imaging
    - Object detection
    - Recognition Tasks
    ...
- We only focus on "Object detection" and "Face recognition"

- Installation & Tutorials <update soon>

    I. Run in terminal
        ```
        pip install -r requirements

    II. Download yolov3.weights [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ppad5GbY5mX8axvnTEKFgMmvxqtQvn3k/view?usp=sharing) and move it into ```/Object_Detection/models/```
    
    or 
    ```
    cd Object_Detection/models
    wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
    ```

    III. Run
        ```
        python main.py
